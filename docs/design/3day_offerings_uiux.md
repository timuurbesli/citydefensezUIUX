# Traveler's Offerings System - UI/UX Design Document
*City Defense Z - Strategic Trading Interface*

## 🎯 System Overview

The Traveler's Trading system provides players with meaningful strategic trading decisions, where they must sacrifice one resource type to gain another, creating complex resource management choices with time pressure from the merchant's departure schedule.

### Core Mechanics
- **Frequency:** Triggered when player encounters traveling merchants
- **Duration:** Merchant stays for 1-2 days before leaving
- **Choice Structure:** 3 randomly generated trade options (player can make multiple trades)
- **Trade Types:** Resource exchanges between Ammunition, Resource, Food, and Research Points
- **Strategic Framework:** Resource allocation and opportunity cost decisions with time pressure

## 🎨 Visual Design Integration

### Design Philosophy
The traveler's trading modal integrates with existing UI patterns while establishing its own visual identity as a crucial economic decision moment.

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary Focus:** Three premium trade cards with enhanced visual effects
2. **Secondary:** Merchant countdown timer and resource availability indicators  
3. **Tertiary:** Trading strategy guidance and affordability feedback

**Enhanced Visual Features:**
- **Premium Card Design:** Multi-layered gradients, sophisticated shadows, and glassmorphism effects
- **Dynamic Typography:** Orbitron font family for futuristic, military-grade appearance
- **Animated Elements:** Pulsing exchange arrows, shimmer effects, and interactive hover states
- **Color-Coded Categories:** Profit (Green), Bulk (Gold), Growth (Blue) with glow effects
- **Real-time Feedback:** Live affordability checking with visual state changes

**Color Coding (Consistent with existing system):**
- **Resource (Yellow):** `#FFD700` - Factory/industrial theme
- **Ammunition (Green):** `#32CD32` - Military/defense theme  
- **Food (Red/Brown):** `#DC143C` - Survival/sustenance theme
- **Research Points (Blue):** `#4169E1` - Knowledge/progression theme
- **Trade Arrows:** `#FFA500` - Exchange/transaction indicators

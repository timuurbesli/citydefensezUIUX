## Technical Implementation

### Dialogue System Logic
```
NPC Interaction Flow:
1. Player approaches NPC ‚Üí Trigger interaction zone
2. Random pool selection ‚Üí Choose from 5 available pools
3. Random line selection ‚Üí Pick dialogue from chosen pool
4. UI Animation ‚Üí Fade in dialogue panels
5. Audio playback ‚Üí Voice acting + ambient sound
6. Cooldown period ‚Üí 30-60 seconds before next interaction
```

### Randomization Algorithm
- **Pool Weight System**: Some pools appear more frequently based on game state
- **Contextual Triggers**: Certain pools activate based on:
  - Time of day
  - Recent events (attacks, victories, resource changes)
  - Player actions
  - Seasonal changes

### Audio Design
- **Voice Acting**: Distinct voice actors for each NPC type
- **Background Audio**: Radio static, ambient environment sounds
- **Audio Cues**: UI sound effects for panel transitions
- **Waveform Display**: Real-time audio visualization during dialogue

---

## UX Flow States

### Initial Approach
- NPC shows interaction prompt
- Character portrait begins subtle idle animation
- Audio indicator shows "ready to transmit"

### Active Dialogue
- Smooth panel slide-in animation (0.3s duration)
- Text appears with typewriter effect
- Audio waveform animates with voice
- Character portrait shows speaking animation

### Dialogue Complete
- Brief pause (2 seconds)
- Fade out animation
- Return to idle state
- Cooldown timer begins

### Cooldown State
- Reduced interaction prompt visibility
- Character shows "busy" animation
- Timer countdown for next available interaction

---

## Accessibility Features

### Visual Accessibility
- High contrast text options
- Subtitle display for all audio
- Scalable UI elements (50%-150%)
- Colorblind-friendly palette options

### Audio Accessibility
- Visual waveform representation
- Dialogue text always visible
- Audio level controls
- Option to disable audio and use text-only

### Interaction Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Extended interaction time options
- Skip dialogue options
- Replay last dialogue function

---

## Integration Notes

### Game State Dependencies
- Dialogue pools adapt to current game progression
- Character availability based on storyline events
- Seasonal dialogue variations
- Emergency/crisis mode dialogue overrides

### Performance Considerations
- Preload character portraits and common UI elements
- Efficient audio streaming for voice lines
- Minimal memory footprint for dialogue storage
- Smooth 60fps animations on target hardware
